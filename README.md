# MAT-11613159-Report-Appendix
This repository is for reproducing the contents of MAT-11613159-report.pdf. It contains the datasets used in the experiments, some R code, some Python code, and instructions for using the code.

!!!Statement:ES_F_data.csv is publicly available data from Yahoo Finance and does not pose any data ethics risks. This dataset records historical public data of the S&P 500, including closing prices, trading volumes, and other information, from June 23, 2022, to June 19, 2025.

!!!Before using the R and Python code, please pay attention to the !!!IMPORTANT!!! notes in the comments. All code requires modification of the dataset input paths in the original code, as the original code uses the author's own storage paths. If users do not make these changes, the code will not run correctly.

!!!The R code is stored as text. Users can follow the prompts to modify the input paths in the code to their own storage paths and then directly copy and paste it into R to run.
